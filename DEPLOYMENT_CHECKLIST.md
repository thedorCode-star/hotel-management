# ðŸš€ CI/CD Deployment Checklist

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Setup

### âœ… **Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup**
- [ ] Repository is public or has GitHub Actions enabled
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured (recommended)
- [ ] Team has access to repository

### âœ… **Step 2: Vercel Project Setup**
- [ ] Create Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- [ ] Import your GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure project settings
- [ ] Note down your project details

### âœ… **Step 3: Get Vercel Credentials**
- [ ] **VERCEL_TOKEN**: Create from Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Tokens
- [ ] **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Copy from Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ General â†’ Team ID
- [ ] **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: Copy from Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ General â†’ Project ID

### âœ… **Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:
   ```
   VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token_here
   VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id_here
   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id_here
   ```

## ðŸ§ª **Step 5: Test the Pipeline**

### **Test Staging Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# 2. Make a small change (add a comment, update README)
echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md

# 3. Commit and push to develop
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: staging deployment test"
git push origin develop

# 4. Check GitHub Actions
# Go to Actions tab in your repository
# Watch the pipeline run
```

### **Expected Results**
- âœ… Code Quality & Security job passes
- âœ… Test Suite job passes (all 220 tests)
- âœ… Build & Quality Gates job passes
- âœ… Performance Testing job passes
- âœ… Staging Deployment job passes
- âœ… Post-Deployment Validation job passes

### **Check Staging Deployment**
- [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Verify staging deployment is live
- [ ] Test the application functionality
- [ ] Check health endpoint: `https://your-staging-url.vercel.app/health`

## ðŸš€ **Step 6: Production Deployment**

### **Test Production Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Merge develop branch
git merge develop

# 3. Push to main (triggers production deployment)
git push origin main

# 4. Monitor the pipeline
# This will deploy to production
```

### **Production Verification**
- [ ] Production deployment completes successfully
- [ ] Application is accessible at production URL
- [ ] Health check passes: `https://your-production-url.vercel.app/health`
- [ ] All functionality works in production
- [ ] Database connections are working
- [ ] Stripe payments are working (if applicable)

## ðŸ”§ **Step 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Pipeline Fails on Code Quality**
```bash
# Fix ESLint issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Fix TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Commit and push again
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve linting and type issues"
git push origin develop
```

### **Pipeline Fails on Tests**
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm run test

# Check specific failing tests
npm run test -- --verbose

# Fix failing tests and push again
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve failing tests"
git push origin develop
```

### **Pipeline Fails on Build**
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Check for missing dependencies
npm install

# Verify Prisma setup
npm run db:generate

# Push again
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve build issues"
git push origin develop
```

### **Deployment Fails**
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment logs
- [ ] Verify GitHub secrets are correct
- [ ] Check environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Ensure database is accessible from Vercel

## ðŸ“Š **Step 8: Monitor & Optimize**

### **Daily Monitoring**
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions for any failures
- [ ] Monitor Vercel deployment status
- [ ] Check application performance
- [ ] Review security audit results

### **Weekly Review**
- [ ] Analyze test coverage trends
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Optimize build times if needed

### **Monthly Optimization**
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review and optimize CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Analyze deployment patterns
- [ ] Plan infrastructure improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 9: Advanced Features**

### **Add Notifications**
- [ ] Configure Slack/Discord webhooks
- [ ] Set up email notifications
- [ ] Add SMS alerts for critical failures

### **Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Configure Lighthouse CI thresholds
- [ ] Add performance budgets

### **Security Enhancements**
- [ ] Enable automated dependency updates
- [ ] Set up security scanning
- [ ] Configure vulnerability alerts

## ðŸš¨ **Emergency Procedures**

### **Production Rollback**
```bash
# If production deployment fails
# Vercel automatically rolls back to previous version
# Check Vercel dashboard for rollback status
# Investigate the issue
# Fix and redeploy
```

### **Pipeline Disable**
```bash
# If you need to disable CI/CD temporarily
# Go to GitHub repository â†’ Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
# Disable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
```

### **Manual Deployment**
```bash
# If CI/CD is down, deploy manually
vercel --prod
```

## ðŸ“š **Useful Commands**

### **Git Commands**
```bash
# Check branch status
git status
git branch -a

# Switch branches
git checkout develop
git checkout main

# View commit history
git log --oneline -10

# View pipeline status
gh run list
```

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific tests
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=Navigation.test.tsx

# Check code quality
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Build application
npm run build
```

### **Vercel Commands**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to staging
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# View deployment status
vercel ls
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success Criteria**

### **Pipeline Success**
- [ ] All 7 jobs complete successfully
- [ ] Staging deployment is accessible
- [ ] Production deployment is accessible
- [ ] Health checks pass on both environments
- [ ] All functionality works in both environments
