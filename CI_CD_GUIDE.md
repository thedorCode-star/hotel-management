## 🎯 What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**. It's like having an automated assembly line for your code that:

- ✅ **Automatically tests** every code change
- ✅ **Automatically builds** your application
- ✅ **Automatically deploys** to staging and production
- ✅ **Ensures quality** before code reaches users
- ✅ **Reduces human errors** in deployment

## 🏗️ Our Pipeline Architecture

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of **7 specialized jobs** that run in sequence:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Code Quality │    │   Test Suite    │    │ Build & Validate│
│   & Security   │───▶│                 │───▶│                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                ▲                       ▲
                                │                       │
                        ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
                        │ Performance     │    │ Performance     │
                        │ Testing         │    │ Testing         │
                        └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 🔍 Job 1: Code Quality & Security
- **Purpose**: Ensures code meets quality standards
- **What it does**:
  - Runs ESLint for code style
  - Performs TypeScript type checking
  - Runs security audits
  - Analyzes code coverage
- **When it runs**: On every push and pull request

### 🧪 Job 2: Test Suite
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing across environments
- **What it does**:
  - Runs all 220+ tests
  - Tests against multiple Node.js versions (18, 20)
  - Tests against multiple PostgreSQL versions (15, 16)
  - Generates coverage reports
- **When it runs**: On every push and pull request

### 🏗️ Job 3: Build & Quality Gates
- **Purpose**: Builds the application and validates quality
- **What it does**:
  - Generates Prisma client
  - Builds Next.js application
  - Analyzes build size
  - Uploads build artifacts
- **When it runs**: After code quality and tests pass

### ⚡ Job 4: Performance Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensures application performance meets standards
- **What it does**:
  - Runs Lighthouse CI performance tests
  - Validates accessibility, SEO, and best practices
  - Generates performance reports
- **When it runs**: After successful build

### 🚀 Job 5: Staging Deployment
- **Purpose**: Deploys to staging environment for testing
- **What it does**:
  - Deploys to Vercel staging
  - Performs health checks
  - Notifies deployment status
- **When it runs**: When pushing to `develop` branch

### 🚀 Job 6: Production Deployment
- **Purpose**: Deploys to production environment
- **What it does**:
  - Deploys to Vercel production
  - Performs production health checks
  - Sends production notifications
- **When it runs**: When pushing to `main` branch

### ✅ Job 7: Post-Deployment Validation
- **Purpose**: Final validation and reporting
- **What it does**:
  - Validates both deployments
  - Generates deployment summary
  - Ensures everything is working
- **When it runs**: After both deployments complete

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Code Push Trigger**
```bash
git push origin develop  # Triggers staging deployment
git push origin main     # Triggers production deployment
```

### 2. **Automated Pipeline Execution**
- GitHub Actions automatically detects the push
- Pipeline starts with code quality checks
- Each job waits for previous jobs to succeed
- Failures stop the pipeline immediately

### 3. **Quality Gates**
- **Code Quality**: Must pass ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **Security**: Must pass security audit
- **Tests**: All 220+ tests must pass
- **Build**: Application must build successfully
- **Performance**: Must meet Lighthouse performance standards

### 4. **Deployment Process**
```
Staging (develop branch):
├── Code Quality ✅
├── Tests ✅
├── Build ✅
├── Performance ✅
└── Deploy to Staging 🚀

Production (main branch):
├── Code Quality ✅
├── Tests ✅
├── Build ✅
├── Performance ✅
├── Staging Validation ✅
└── Deploy to Production 🚀
```

## 🔐 Setting Up Secrets

To use this pipeline, you need to configure these secrets in GitHub:

### 1. **Go to GitHub Repository Settings**
```
Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
```

### 2. **Add Required Secrets**
```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token_here
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id_here
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id_here
```

### 3. **How to Get Vercel Secrets**

#### **VERCEL_TOKEN**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your profile → Settings → Tokens
3. Create a new token with full scope
4. Copy the token value

#### **VERCEL_ORG_ID**
1. In Vercel Dashboard, go to Settings → General
2. Copy the "Team ID" (this is your org ID)

#### **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**
1. In your Vercel project, go to Settings → General
2. Copy the "Project ID"

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

We follow a **Git Flow** strategy:

```
main (production)
├── develop (staging)
│   ├── feature/user-authentication
│   ├── feature/booking-system
│   └── feature/payment-integration
└── hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```

### **Branch Rules**
- **`main`**: Production-ready code only
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature development
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes

### **Deployment Triggers**
- **Push to `develop`** → Deploy to Staging
- **Push to `main`** → Deploy to Production
- **Pull Request** → Run tests and quality checks

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### **Staging Deployment (develop branch)**
1. **Automatic Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
2. **Pipeline Execution**: All quality checks run
3. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Vercel staging
4. **Health Check**: Automated health check after deployment
5. **Notification**: Success/failure notification

### **Production Deployment (main branch)**
1. **Automatic Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
2. **Pipeline Execution**: All quality checks run
3. **Staging Validation**: Ensures staging is working
4. **Production Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Vercel production
5. **Health Check**: Production health check
6. **Notification**: Production deployment status

### **Rollback Process**
If production deployment fails:
1. **Immediate Notification**: Team is alerted
2. **Previous Version**: Vercel automatically rolls back
3. **Investigation**: Team investigates the issue
4. **Fix & Redeploy**: Fix the issue and redeploy

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts

### **Pipeline Status**
- **Green Checkmark** ✅: All jobs passed
- **Red X** ❌: One or more jobs failed
- **Yellow Circle** ⏳: Job is running

### **Notifications**
- **Success**: Deployment URL and status
- **Failure**: Detailed error information
- **Security Issues**: Security audit results
- **Performance Issues**: Lighthouse performance scores

### **Artifacts**
- **Test Results**: Coverage reports and test outputs
- **Security Reports**: Audit findings and recommendations
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled application files
- **Performance Reports**: Lighthouse performance metrics

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. Pipeline Fails on Code Quality**
```bash
# Fix ESLint issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Fix TypeScript errors
npm run type-check
```

#### **2. Tests Fail**
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm run test

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=Navigation.test.tsx
```

#### **3. Build Fails**
```bash
# Check for build errors
npm run build

# Verify Prisma setup
npm run db:generate
```

#### **4. Deployment Fails**
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment logs
- Verify secrets are correctly configured
- Check environment variables in Vercel

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check pipeline status
gh run list

# View pipeline logs
gh run view <run-id>

# Rerun failed pipeline
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

## 🎯 Best Practices
